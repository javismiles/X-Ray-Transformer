# X-Ray-Transformer Infographic
Dive into transformers training & inference computations through a singleÂ visual, an all in one x-ray of the model that gave rise to GPT-3. Explore computations and transformations end to end during training and inference. The X-Ray Transformer infographic allows you to make the journey from the beginning to the end of the transformer's computations in both the training and inference phases. Its objective is to achieve a quick and deep understanding of the inner computations of a transformer model through the analysis and exploration of a single visual asset.
